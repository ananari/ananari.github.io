    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Anaïs Ahmed, and I live is Austin, Texas. 
      I graduated from the Uni­versity of Chicago in 2016, with a BA 
      in Linguistics.

      Nowadays, I am a mobile developer working at Bright Health. 
      When not at work, the bulk of projects that I have worked on 
      are language-related — I have made an iOS keyboard to help 
      type the Syloti Nagri alphabet, used to write the Sylheti 
      language, spoken in north­eastern Bangladesh and India. 
      My Github is <a href="https://github.com/ananari/">here</a>.
      You can also find me regularly Tweeting about languages 
      and programming <a href="https://twitter.com/tramslinguistic">
      here</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Apart from linguistics and programming, my biggest interests 
      are music and typography. I am an accordionist and singer, and 
      I used to sing and play with the choir <a href="http://www.golosa.org/">
      Golosa</a> for many years. Lately I have been getting into 
      type design, with a particular interest in making typefaces 
      for Syloti Nagri that represent the diversity in Sylheti books, 
      as well as exercising my own creativity in making new Sylheti 
      typefaces.
